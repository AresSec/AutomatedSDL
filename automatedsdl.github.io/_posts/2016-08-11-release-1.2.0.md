The main new features are:

* central CAS logout
* when using SecurityRAT's own user management, you can decide whether you want to allow users register themselves, or whether only the administrator can create new users by editing the `application.yml`configuration file:

```
authentication:
  type: FORM 
  registration: false # set to true if anonymous users should be able to register accounts themselves
``` 

{% include links.html %}
